# Phase 4 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 4 completes the core school management system by implementing the **Performance** and **Fees** modules. These modules provide comprehensive tracking of student academic performance and financial management capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Performance Module

### Domain Layer
- **`performance.ts`**: Defines the `Performance` domain entity with score, comments, grade, submission/grading dates, and relationships to Student and Assignment.

### DTOs
- **`create-performance.dto.ts`**: Validates performance creation with score (0-100), comments, grade, submission/grading dates, and student/assignment references.
- **`update-performance.dto.ts`**: Extends create DTO for partial updates.
- **`query-performance.dto.ts`**: Supports filtering by student name, assignment title, score range, grade, and date ranges with pagination and sorting.

### Infrastructure Layer
- **`performance.repository.ts`**: Abstract repository interface with methods for CRUD operations and specialized queries.
- **`performance.entity.ts`**: TypeORM entity with proper relationships to Student and Assignment entities.
- **`performance.mapper.ts`**: Maps between domain and persistence layers, handling nested objects.
- **`performance.repository.ts` (implementation)**: TypeORM implementation with advanced querying capabilities.
- **`relational-persistence.module.ts`**: NestJS module for dependency injection.

### Service Layer
- **`performance.service.ts`**: Business logic including:
  - Duplicate performance prevention (one performance record per student per assignment)
  - DTO-to-domain transformation
  - CRUD operations with validation

### Controller Layer
- **`performance.controller.ts`**: RESTful API endpoints with:
  - Standard CRUD operations
  - Specialized endpoints: `findByStudent`, `findByAssignment`, `findByStudentAndAssignment`
  - JWT authentication and admin role protection
  - Swagger documentation

### Module
- **`performance.module.ts`**: NestJS module configuration with proper dependency injection.

## ðŸ’° Fees Module

### Domain Layer
- **`fee.ts`**: Defines the `Fee` domain entity with:
  - `PaymentStatus` enum: PAID, UNPAID, PARTIAL, OVERDUE
  - `PaymentMethod` enum: CASH, BANK_TRANSFER, CREDIT_CARD, DEBIT_CARD, CHECK, ONLINE
  - Amount, status, payment details, due/paid dates, and relationships to Student and Class.

### DTOs
- **`create-fee.dto.ts`**: Validates fee creation with amount, status, payment method, transaction ID, due date, and student/class references.
- **`update-fee.dto.ts`**: Extends create DTO for partial updates.
- **`query-fee.dto.ts`**: Supports filtering by student name, class name, status, amount range, and date ranges with pagination and sorting.

### Infrastructure Layer
- **`fee.repository.ts`**: Abstract repository interface with methods for CRUD operations and specialized queries.
- **`fee.entity.ts`**: TypeORM entity with decimal precision for amounts and proper relationships.
- **`fee.mapper.ts`**: Maps between domain and persistence layers, handling nested objects.
- **`fee.repository.ts` (implementation)**: TypeORM implementation with advanced querying and overdue fee detection.
- **`relational-persistence.module.ts`**: NestJS module for dependency injection.

### Service Layer
- **`fees.service.ts`**: Business logic including:
  - DTO-to-domain transformation
  - CRUD operations with validation
  - Specialized `markAsPaid` method for payment processing
  - Overdue fee detection

### Controller Layer
- **`fees.controller.ts`**: RESTful API endpoints with:
  - Standard CRUD operations
  - Specialized endpoints: `findByStudent`, `findByClass`, `findByStudentAndClass`, `findOverdueFees`
  - Payment processing endpoint: `markAsPaid`
  - JWT authentication and admin role protection
  - Swagger documentation

### Module
- **`fees.module.ts`**: NestJS module configuration with proper dependency injection.

## ðŸ”— Integration

### App Module Updates
- Added `PerformanceModule` and `FeesModule` to `app.module.ts` imports
- Both modules are now available throughout the application

### Database Migration
- **`1715028537219-CreatePerformanceAndFees.ts`**: Creates performance and fee tables with:
  - Proper foreign key relationships to existing tables
  - Indexes for performance optimization
  - Enum types for status and payment method constraints
  - Decimal precision for monetary amounts
